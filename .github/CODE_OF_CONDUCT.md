# Code of Conduct

We want our projects to be welcoming, respectful, and safe for everyone. This Code of Conduct explains expected behavior, what is unacceptable, how to report issues, and how we’ll respond.

## Scope and commitment

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces: issue trackers, pull requests, mailing lists, chat channels, and in-person events when representing the project.

We are committed to providing a friendly, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for all contributors, maintainers, and participants.

## Expected and unacceptable behavior

### Expected behavior

- Be respectful and considerate in language and actions.
- Assume positive intent and give constructive, actionable feedback.
- Be welcoming to newcomers and help others when you can.
- Keep discussions on-topic and focused on solving problems.

### Unacceptable behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, threats, or intimidation of any kind.
- Discrimination or hateful language targeting protected characteristics.
- Personal attacks, insults, or doxxing (sharing private information).
- Deliberate disruption, trolling, or spamming.
- Retaliation against anyone who reports a concern.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it to the project maintainers at [community@newgent.digital](mailto:community@newgent.digital). If you prefer to remain anonymous, use our anonymous reporting form: https://whistle.newgent.digital/.

When reporting, please include: what happened, when and where it occurred, and any relevant screenshots or links. We don’t require proof — tell us what you know.

## Enforcement

Reports will be reviewed and handled with care and confidentiality. Possible actions include a private warning, temporary or permanent removal from project spaces, or other measures appropriate to the violation.

Decisions will be made by project maintainers or designated community moderators. If you have concerns about how a report was handled, contact [community@newgent.digital](mailto:community@newgent.digital) with your concerns.

## A note on tone

We encourage a friendly and inclusive tone. That said, following this Code of Conduct may require firm action in some cases — the goal is to keep the community safe and productive for everyone.
