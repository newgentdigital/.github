## Help yourself first

Before reaching out, these resources might already have what you're looking for:

### 📚 Diving into documentation

- **Repository README files** — Each project has setup instructions, usage examples, and common gotchas.
- **Wiki pages** — For deep-dive technical docs and architectural decisions.
- **API documentation** — If we have it, it's probably linked from the README.
- **Code examples** — Look for `examples/` or `demos/` folders in repositories.

### 🔎 Search like a detective

- **GitHub search** — Search issues and discussions across all our repositories. Someone might've asked your question!
- **Pull request descriptions** — Sometimes, the best explanations are in PR descriptions and review comments.

> [!TIP]
> Search for error messages in quotes — like "TypeError: Cannot read property" — to find exact matches.

## How to get better help faster

### 📝 Making questions easy to answer

- **Give us context:** What you're trying to achieve, what you tried, what happened vs. expected, and your environment (OS, versions, browser, etc.).
- **Share relevant details:** Full error messages, formatted code snippets, and screenshots or recordings that illustrate the problem.
- **Keep it focused:** One question per issue, a specific title, and a clear, concise description.

### 👍 What makes us happy

#### Good examples

- "The documentation says to do A, but I'm getting B instead. Am I missing something?"
- "I found what looks like a bug in the email validation. Here's how to reproduce it..."

#### Not so helpful — what to avoid (and what to do instead)

- "It doesn't work"  
   **Instead**: say what you tried, what you expected, and what actually happened (with errors/logs/screenshots).

- "Your software is broken"  
   **Instead**: describe the feature, the exact steps to reproduce, and why you believe it's a bug.

- "This is urgent!!!" (without explaining why)  
   **Instead**: explain the impact, deadline, and any workarounds tried so responders can prioritize.

## Community support

### 🤝 Help others, help yourself

When you answer questions, even if you're not an expert, sharing your experience helps others who might be facing similar challenges.

If you find documentation that's confusing or unclear, don't struggle through it — fix it or let us know how to improve. When you solve a tricky problem, take a moment to share how you did it, because your solution might save the next person hours of debugging.

**Remember when you were new to all of this?** Pay it forward by welcoming newcomers and helping them find their footing in our community.

### 🌟 Become a community hero

Regular contributors often become unofficial community helpers, and that's awesome! If you're interested in taking on a more formal mentoring or support role, reach out to [community@newgent.digital](mailto:community@newgent.digital).
